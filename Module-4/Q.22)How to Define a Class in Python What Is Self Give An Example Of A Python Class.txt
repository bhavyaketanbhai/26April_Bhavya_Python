22.How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of
A Python Class

A)To define a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class and a colon. The class definition is indented, and it typically includes methods and attributes.

The `self` keyword in Python refers to the instance of the class that is currently being worked with. It is a reference to the object that is created from the class and is used to access its attributes and methods.


class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start(self):
        print("The car is starting.")

    def stop(self):
        print("The car is stopping.")

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2021)
print(my_car.make)
my_car.start()
